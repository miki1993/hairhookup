        <p> 
            Hair Hookup was born out of the decision to create a platform that we ourselves needed: a way to find local stylists and products, and also a platform to talk to other people about haircare. Our endeavour is twofold, to simplify the haircare and hairdressing experience for customers, and to empower stylists to grow their businesses.

            No matter where in the UK, Hair Hookup provides a centralised platform where people can find local stylists and crowdsource information on haircare.  If you have specific hairdressing needs like a price range or time frame, use our forums to request a stylist. Alternatively, browse through our curated list of hairdressers on our Listings page.
          
            Now for the stylists : at the core of Hair Hookup, our goal is to empower the small business owner. Itâ€™s aim is to provide a platform that helps stylists improve the ways they advertise their services and provide a booking software to help save time and money. Hairdressing is a pillar of the black diaspora, its helped aunties keep the lights on and put their children through school, and young women pay their way through university or bypass it altogether and start successful salons.

            Mukundwa has always been passionate about hair. From 3 years old she's engaged with her hair, albeit more constructively in later years. Relocating to England in 2012, she discovered that the black hair industry could do with a few tweaks that would improve the hairdressing experience for stylist and customer alike. Fast forward 5 years and dozens of unsatifactory hairdressing experiences later, Hair Hookup was born. 
            
            Mukundwa is also the only worker bee. If long hours, no pay but light at the end of a hairy tunnel appeals to you, drop her a line! info@hairhookup.co.uk
